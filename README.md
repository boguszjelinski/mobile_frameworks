# Mobile frameworks in 2020
I just wanted to check out what it is like to write mobile software in 2020 - which framework I would prefer because of ease of use, look&feel and technical details. Are there some "blockers" even if I mean by this a steep learning curve (as for now canvas in NativeScript is a blocker). 

The idea was to check if creating a simple compass app would be feasible. It would check both a native API (GPS here) and animation on the canvas. Only cross-platform frameworks were considered, even if I think we don't need Apple any more (unless they start producing a little urban EV for little money, which is unlikely). So Flutter, ReactNative, Ionic and NativeScript were given a try.
